# 🔍 Loan Approval System - Complete Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Loan Approval System is a comprehensive feature that allows admins to review, approve, or reject loan requests before they become visible to lenders. This ensures quality control and prevents inappropriate loan requests from reaching the lending marketplace.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Enhanced Loan Routes (`Server/routes/loanroutes.js`)

  - `GET /loans/admin/pending` - Get only pending loans for review
  - `GET /loans/admin/stats` - Get comprehensive loan statistics
  - `PATCH /loans/admin/approve/:id` - Approve a loan with optional reason
  - `PATCH /loans/admin/reject/:id` - Reject a loan with reason

#### 2. Enhanced Notification System
- Automatic notifications sent to borrowers when loans are approved/rejected
- Different notification types: `loan_approved`, `loan_rejected`
