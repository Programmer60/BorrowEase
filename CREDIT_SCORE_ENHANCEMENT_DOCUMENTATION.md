### 2. **Enhanced Risk Assessment Integration**
**File**: `Server/routes/aiRoutes.js` (Lines 75-210)

```javascript
const calculateRiskScore = async (user, loans = []) => {
  // Enhanced algorithm with credit score integration
  // Weight Distribution:
  // - Credit Score Impact: 40% (most important)
  // - Payment History: 25%

## 📊 Credit Scoring Methodology

### **Payment History (35% Weight - 192 Points Max)**
```javascript
const paymentHistoryScore = totalLoans > 0 ? (repaidLoans / totalLoans) * 192 : 0;
```
- **Calculation**: (Repaid Loans / Total Loans) × 192
- **Impact**: Most significant factor in credit assessment
- **Range**: 0-192 points

### **Credit Utilization (30% Weight - 165 Points Max)**
```javascript
const utilizationScore = Math.min(165, Math.max(0, 165 - (avgLoanSize / 10000) * 20));
```
- **Calculation**: 165 - (Average Loan Size / 10000) × 20
- **Impact**: Measures borrowing behavior and debt management
- **Range**: 0-165 points

### **Credit History Length (15% Weight - 82 Points Max)**
```javascript
const historyScore = Math.min(82, historyMonths * 3);
```
- **Calculation**: Months of credit history × 3 (capped at 82)
- **Impact**: Rewards established credit relationships
- **Range**: 0-82 points

### **Loan Diversity (10% Weight - 55 Points Max)**
```javascript
const diversityScore = Math.min(55, loanPurposes.size * 15);
```
- **Calculation**: Number of loan types × 15 (capped at 55)
- **Impact**: Rewards experience with different loan types
- **Range**: 0-55 points

### **KYC and Trust Factors (10% Weight - 55 Points Max)**
```javascript
let trustScore = 0;
if (user.kycStatus === 'verified') trustScore += 30;
if (user.trustScore > 70) trustScore += 25;
```
- **Components**: KYC verification (30 pts) + High trust score (25 pts)
- **Impact**: Validates identity and platform trustworthiness
- **Range**: 0-55 points

## 🔄 Risk Assessment Integration

### **Risk Score Calculation Enhancement**
The enhanced algorithm now considers:

1. **Credit Score Impact (40% weight)**
   ```javascript
   const creditScoreImpact = ((creditData.score - 300) / 550) * 40;
   ```

2. **Payment History Analysis (25% weight)**
   ```javascript
   const paymentImpact = (paymentHistoryScore / 192) * 25;
   ```

3. **Credit Utilization Assessment (15% weight)**
   ```javascript
   const utilizationImpact = (utilizationScore / 100) * 15;
   ```

4. **Credit History Length (10% weight)**
   ```javascript
   const historyImpact = Math.min(10, historyMonths * 0.5);
   ```

5. **Verification Status (5% weight)**
6. **Active Loan Management (5% weight)**
